My variation of MIT60001 OCW's Problem Set 3: Word Game

Instructions for vanilla version:

- This is a console/terminal only program created using Spyder
1. Make sure all files are saved to the same directory/folder
2. Open not-scrabble-ta.py in an IDE console or terminal
3. Run file ("F5" in Spyder, "Shift" + "F10" in PyCharm) or run in console.
4. Read through console prompts and enter word guesses, or opt to replace a letter first.
5. If your guess is a word in the database, it will be scored. If your guess is not a word, you will be asked to try again.
6. If you can no longer figure out any words or if you wish to quit, submit "!!" at any time.
